# Changelog - Garderobe Digital

## [4.3.0] - 2025-10-09 - Staff View Fix & Architecture Improvement 🔧

### Critical Bug Fix

**Staff View Caching Issue (Resolved):**
- ✅ Fixed staff seeing wrong ticket status when rescanning already-checked-in tickets
- ✅ Browser was caching server-rendered HTML, showing outdated "Check In Coat" button
- ✅ **Root cause:** Server-side rendering of dynamic data + aggressive browser caching (bfcache)
- ✅ **Solution:** Architectural change to client-side data fetching

### Architecture Changes

**Ticket Status Rendering:**
- ✅ Server now renders static skeleton only (no status, no buttons)
- ✅ JavaScript fetches fresh status from `/e/:slug/api/status/:id` API on page load
- ✅ Status and buttons rendered client-side based on API response
- ✅ **Result:** Even if HTML is cached, data is always fresh from API

**Staff Authentication (Simplified):**
- ✅ Removed session-based authentication entirely (express-session, connect-redis)
- ✅ Pure token-based authentication via staffToken in URL/query/body
- ✅ Simpler architecture, more reliable across all browsers and contexts
- ✅ No more cookie issues, works with any navigation pattern

### UX Improvements

**Check-In Flow:**
- ✅ After check-in: Shows prominent location display "Place coat in C-15"
- ✅ Checkout button appears after 2 seconds (staff can scan next ticket or check out immediately)
- ✅ Removed confusing UI states that restored old content after actions

### Code Cleanup

**Removed Failed Attempts:**
- ❌ Cache-control headers (didn't prevent browser caching)
- ❌ Pageshow event listeners (unreliable across browsers)
- ❌ Server-side status passing to templates (caused the bug)
- ✅ Cleaner codebase with correct separation of concerns

### Technical Details

**Modified Files:**
- `src/server.js` - Removed express-session and connect-redis setup, simplified startup
- `src/routes.js` - Removed `isStaffForEvent()` helper, simplified authentication to pure token-based
- `src/routes.js` - Removed status/location from staff-ticket template rendering
- `src/routes.js` - Simplified `requireStaffAuth` middleware to only check tokens (no session fallback)
- `src/views/staff-ticket.ejs` - Complete rewrite: skeleton HTML + client-side API fetching
- `src/views/staff-ticket.ejs` - Improved check-in/checkout flow with better state management
- `package.json` - Removed express-session and connect-redis dependencies
- `.env.example` - Removed SESSION_SECRET (no longer needed)

**Key Insight:**
Modern browsers aggressively cache pages for back/forward navigation (bfcache). No amount of cache headers reliably prevents this. The correct solution is **separating data from presentation** - render static HTML, fetch dynamic data client-side via API. This is how SPAs avoid caching issues.

### Breaking Changes

None. Fully backward compatible. All functionality preserved, just more reliable.

### Technical Changes

**Deployment:**
- ✅ `deploy-remote.sh` script for easy remote deployment from local machine
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS with Caddy and Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Environment variable configuration via `.env`

**Security:**
- ✅ Updated SECURITY.md to reflect camera permission change

## [4.0.1] - 2025-10-08 - Security Hardened ✅

### Security Improvements

**Bot Protection:**
- ✅ Custom math challenge system (no external CAPTCHA services)
- ✅ Simple arithmetic challenges (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- ✅ 5-minute challenge TTL with one-time use
- ✅ Challenge rate limiting (20 requests/hour per IP)

**Platform Limits:**
- ✅ Global active events limit (1000 max)
- ✅ Global hourly creation limit (100 events/hour platform-wide)
- ✅ Per-IP hourly limit (10 events/hour per IP)

- ✅ HSTS header (production only): `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) - Prevents XSS attacks
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY - Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- ✅ Permissions-Policy - Disables geolocation, camera, microphone

**Session Security:**
- ✅ SameSite=Strict cookies for CSRF protection
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies (already implemented)

### Attack Mitigation Summary

All critical attack vectors addressed:
- ✅ Event creation bot attacks → Math challenge + multi-layer rate limiting

- ✅ Man-in-the-middle (MITM) → HSTS headers
- ✅ Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) → SameSite cookies
